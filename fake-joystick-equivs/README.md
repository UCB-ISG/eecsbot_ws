# Fake debian packages created with "equivs"

These are created with "equivs" tool, to artificially
satisfy dependencies that are currently missing from ROS Noetic repositories.

Don't use these once the real "ros-noetic-ps3joy" & "ros-noetic-wiimote" become available.

Created with "equivs-buils ros-noetic-XXXXX" command (generates .deb file).
Install with "dpkg -i ros-noetic-XXXXX.deb".

(Possibly a real package will automatically replace due to higher version number?)
